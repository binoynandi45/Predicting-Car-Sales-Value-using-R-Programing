# Predicting-Car-Sales-Value-using-R-Programing
R-Programing

The main aim of this project is to predict the price of used cars using the various Machine Learning (ML) models. This can enable the customers to make decisions based on different inputs.
To check if the model is acccepting the Null Hypothesis-either  there 
is no relation between the dependant variable and the independent variable. And the Altenative
Hypothesis says that atleast one independent variable has relation with the dependent variable.
If the p-value is less than 0.05 means we reject the Null Hypothesis nd accpect the alternative
Hypothesis.
